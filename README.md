Codebase Digest is a command-line tool written in Python that helps you analyze and understand your codebase. It provides a structured overview of your project's directory structure, file sizes, token counts, and even consolidates the content of all text-based files into a single output for easy analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Installation

### Via pip (Recommended)

```bash
pip install codebase-digest
````


### From source

````bash
git clone https://github.com/kamilstanuch/codebase-digest.git
cd codebase-digest
pip install -r requirements.txt
````


## Usage

Basic usage:

````bash
cdigest [path_to_directory] [options]
````


Examples:

1. Analyze a project with default settings:
   ```bash
   cdigest /path/to/my_project
   ```

2. Analyze with custom depth and output format:
   ```bash
   cdigest /path/to/my_project -d 3 -o markdown
   ```

3. Ignore specific files and folders:
   ```bash
   cdigest /path/to/my_project --ignore "*.log" "temp_folder" "config.ini"
   ```

4. Show file sizes and include git directory:
   ```bash
   cdigest /path/to/my_project --show-size --include-git
   ```

5. Analyze and copy output to clipboard:
   ```bash
   cdigest /path/to/my_project --copy-to-clipboard
   ```

## Configuration

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `path_to_directory` | Path to the directory you want to analyze |
| `-d, --max-depth` | Maximum depth for directory traversal |
| `-o, --output-format` | Output format (text, json, markdown, xml, or html). Default: text |
| `-f, --file` | Output file name |
| `--show-size` | Show file sizes in directory tree |
| `--show-ignored` | Show ignored files and directories in tree |
| `--ignore` | Patterns to ignore (e.g., '*.pyc' '.venv' 'node_modules') |
| `--keep-defaults` | Keep default ignore patterns when using --ignore |
| `--no-content` | Exclude file contents from the output |
| `--include-git` | Include .git directory in the analysis |
| `--max-size` | Maximum allowed text content size in KB (default: 10240 KB) |
| `--copy-to-clipboard` | Copy the output to clipboard |
| `--no-input` | Surpress all user prompts and default answers to "y" (yes). Useful if you want to use this app as script in your pipelines, e.g. as Github Actions |

## Ignore Functionality

### Default Ignore Patterns

The following patterns are ignored by default:

```python
DEFAULT_IGNORE_PATTERNS = [
'.pyc', '.pyo', '.pyd', 'pycache', # Python
'node_modules', 'bower_components', # JavaScript
'.git', '.svn', '.hg', '.gitignore', # Version control
'venv', '.venv', 'env', # Virtual environments
'.idea', '.vscode', # IDEs
'.log', '.bak', '.swp', '.tmp', # Temporary and log files
'.DS_Store', # macOS
'Thumbs.db', # Windows
'build', 'dist', # Build directories
'.egg-info', # Python egg info
'.so', '.dylib', '.dll' # Compiled libraries
]
```

### Custom Ignore Patterns

You can specify additional patterns to ignore using the `--ignore` option. These patterns will be added to the default ignore patterns unless `--no-default-ignores` is used.

Patterns can use wildcards (* and ?) and can be:
- Filenames (e.g., 'file.txt')
- Directory names (e.g., 'node_modules')
- File extensions (e.g., '*.pyc')
- Paths (e.g., '/path/to/ignore')

Example:
```bash
cdigest /path/to/my_project --ignore ".txt" "temp" "/path/to/specific/file.py"
```


### .cdigestignore File

You can create a `.cdigestignore` file in your project root to specify project-specific ignore patterns. Each line in this file will be treated as an ignore pattern.

### Overriding Default Ignores

To use only your custom ignore patterns without the default ones, use the `--no-default-ignores` option:

```bash
cdigest /path/to/my_project --no-default-ignores --ignore "custom_pattern" "another_pattern"
```
