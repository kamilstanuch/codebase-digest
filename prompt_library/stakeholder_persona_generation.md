# Codebase Stakeholder Persona Generation

**Objective:** Infer potential stakeholder personas based on the functionalities present in the codebase.

**Instructions:**

1. Analyze the codebase to identify distinct user roles and interactions.
2. For each identified role, create a stakeholder persona:
   * Name and role
   * Goals and motivations
   * Pain points and challenges
   * Key interactions with the system
3. Map specific code functionalities to each persona's needs.
4. Identify potential gaps in meeting stakeholder needs.

**Expected Output:** A set of detailed stakeholder personas derived from the codebase, including their goals, challenges, and how the current system addresses their needs.
