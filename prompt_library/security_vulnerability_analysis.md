# Security Vulnerability Analysis of Codebase

**Objective:** Identify potential security vulnerabilities within the provided codebase.

**Instructions:**

1. **Analyze the attached code** with a focus on identifying common security weaknesses such as:
    * SQL injection.
    * Cross-site scripting (XSS).
    * Cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
    * Authentication and authorization bypasses.
    * Data exposure.
2. **For each identified vulnerability, provide a detailed explanation** of:
    * The nature of the vulnerability.
    * The potential impact of exploitation.
    * Recommendations for mitigation using secure coding practices.
3. **Prioritize vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact.**

**Expected Output:** A comprehensive security report highlighting potential vulnerabilities within the codebase, along with clear explanations of their risks and actionable recommendations for remediation.
