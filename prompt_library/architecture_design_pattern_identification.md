## Identify Design Patterns

**Objective:** Analyze the codebase to identify and understand the implementation and purpose of common design patterns.

**Instructions:**

1. **Examine the codebase structure and logic:** Look for recurring code structures, relationships between classes, or ways that common software design problems are addressed.
2. **Identify design pattern instances:** Determine if any of the following design patterns (or others) are used:
    * **Creational Patterns:** Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype
    * **Structural Patterns:** Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy
    * **Behavioral Patterns:** Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor
3. **For each identified pattern:**
    * **Name the pattern.**
    * **Provide a brief description of the pattern** and its general purpose. 
    * **Explain the specific implementation details** within the codebase, including relevant classes, interfaces, and relationships.
    * **Explain the reasoning behind using the pattern** in the context of the codebase. What benefits does it provide? 

**Expected Output:** A structured analysis that:

1. Lists all identified design patterns found in the codebase.
2. Provides a clear description and explanation for each identified pattern instance.
3. Explains the reasoning and benefits of using each design pattern within the specific context of the codebase.
